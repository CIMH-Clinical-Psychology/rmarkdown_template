# rmarkdown_template

Resources and templates for R Markdown stuff.

**THIS REPO IS WORK IN PROGRESS AND WILL FEATURE MORE ELABORATE DESCRIPTIONS AND TUTORIALS IN THE FUTURE.**

## Contents

### HTML example

The file `html_example.Rmd` is an example for a document that results in an html output (`hml_example.html`).
It contains some information about how to use R markdown features like text formatting or citations.

### Full manuscript example

The files `00_example.Rmd` to `04_example_discussion.Rmd` are an example for a full APA manuscript (written in [papaja](https://github.com/crsh/papaja)), which is divided into separate files to improve manageability.

### Bits and pieces

These are files that are used by several of the example files.

#### Bibliography

The `bib_file.bib` contains a bibtex library, where the example documents can draw citations from.

#### Example analysis

The `example_analysis.R` file contains a dummy data "analysis" of the iris data set, which can then be referenced in the example documents.
